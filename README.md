	time.sleep(t)
	os.system(r'taskkill /IM wmplayer.exe')

Functions ->
This can play some songs random. It makes random choice(Random) and then it will choose the song by the generated number. It is easy programe, but i used it to study for my musical test.
You can choose how long the song needs to be played.
Sometimes it will make ERROR, this error means that it could´n find the program to choose so this is not the song that played.
-> EXAMPLE
ERROR: The proces "wmplayer.exe" not found.
Song name
- This is the example of error, so this song name is not played.
SUCCESS: Sent termination signal to the proce "wmplayer.exe" with PID (PID)
Song name
- This is the example of success, so this song was played before it wrote the SUCCESS...
